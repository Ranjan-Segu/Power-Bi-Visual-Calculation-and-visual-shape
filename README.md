Power BI defines the grouping columns (Department, Manager and Employee, in the example), the name of the column that indicates whether a row is a subtotal or not, and their sort order. The last clause of VISUAL SHAPE is the name of the Densification column, a column added to the table to indicate whether the rows have been created because of densification.
